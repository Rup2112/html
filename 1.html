                    English continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher education and in some areas of the Indian government. Hindi, the most commonly spoken language in India today, serves as the lingua franca across much of North and Central India.

                  	<p>The Hindi language is very old, and has a direct line of evolution to Sanskrit. As such it is part of one of the oldest religious and literary traditions in the world – traditions that have influenced other religions and works of art, whether we realise it or not. As such Hindi is incredibly important in the historic development of the world’s cultures, and well worth not just honouring, but studying. Anyone with an interest in world history or languages would do well to do a little bit of intense reading on the subject of Hindi.

India is also a rising power in the world. It still struggles with poverty on a grand scale, but there is every indication that India is emerging as an economic powerhouse. If nothing else, it’s huge population means it is a market that no global business can hope to ignore, and India has additionally signalled clearly its desire to establish itself as a regional superpower. This all means that you can expect India to have a larger and larger impact on the world in both political and artistic arenas</p>

                 <p>Marathi is primarily spoken in Maharashtra (India), and parts of neighbouring states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka (particularly the bordering districts of Belgaum, Bidar, Gulbarga and Uttara Kannada), Telangana, union-territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The former Maratha ruled cities of Baroda, Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur and Tanjore have had sizable Marathi speaking populations for centuries. Marathi is also spoken by Maharashtrian migrants to other parts of India and overseas.[12] For instance, the people from western India, that emigrated to Mauritius in the early 19th century also speak Marathi.[13]

There were 83 million native Marathi speakers in India, according to the 2011 census, making it the third most spoken native language after Hindi and Bengali. Native Marathi speakers form 6.86% of India's population. Native speakers of Marathi formed 68.93% of the population in Maharashtra</p>

	            <p>The Gujarati language is more than 700 years old and is spoken by more than 55 million people worldwide.[7] Outside of Gujarat, Gujarati is spoken in many other parts of South Asia by Gujarati migrants, especially in Bombay and Pakistan (mainly in Karachi).[8] Gujarati is also widely spoken in many countries outside South Asia by the Gujarati diaspora. In North America, Gujarati is one of the fastest growing and most widely spoken Indian languages in the United States and Canada.[9][10] In Europe, Gujaratis form the second largest of the British South Asian speech communities, and Gujarati is the fourth most commonly spoken language in the UK's capital London.[11] Gujarati is also spoken in Southeast Africa, particularly in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and South Africa.[12][13][14] Elsewhere, Gujarati is spoken to a lesser extent in China (particularly Hong Kong), Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, and Middle Eastern countries such as Bahrain.[12][15][16]
